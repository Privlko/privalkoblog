I'm a social researcher based in Dublin, Ireland. Here, I write about Russian inequality using cross sectional and longitudinal data. My main interests are the sociology of work, Russia's place in comparative political economy, its wage inequality, and its social classes at work. I wrote my PhD on the consequences of job mobility in Germany and the UK; from time to time I'll also blog about that. 

Separately, I'm trying to learn about R Studio, data viz, and longitudinal or panel methods of analysis. I'm hoping to gain more experience in these as I write the blog, and make the switch from Stata (which I really love, but can't afford) to RStudio (which I'm enjoying and which is free). 

In these posts I mostly rely on three data sources. They are the [**European Social Survey**](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/country.html?c=russian_federation), [**The Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey**](http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/rlms-hse), and [**Rosstat**](http://www.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_main/rosstat/en/main/). Each of these is open-source, meaning you are free to download the same data and rummage through it.

This website was put together using the simplest available version of R's [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I cannot recommend Alison Hill's [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edyzTo3DF4U&t=661s) enough, it basically built this entire site. 

You can contact me on LinkedIn or twitter, using the links above. Alternatively, you can email me on privalki [at] tcd [dot] ie.
