I'm a social researcher based in Dublin, Ireland. Here, I write about Russian inequality using cross sectional and longitudinal data. My main interests are the sociology of work, Russia's place in comparative political economy, its wage inequality, and its social classes at work. I'm writing a PhD on the consequences of job mobility in Germany and the UK, using panel data; from time to time I blog about this.

Separately, I'm trying to learn how to use R Studio, data vis, and longitudinal methods. I'm hoping to gain more experience in these as I write the blog. Some of the data I use in these posts comes from the [**European Social Survey**](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/country.html?c=russian_federation), [**The Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey**](http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/rlms-hse), and [**Rosstat**](http://www.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_main/rosstat/en/main/). This website was put together using the simplest available version of R's [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I cannot recommend Alison Hill's [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edyzTo3DF4U&t=661s) enough, it basically built this entire site.
