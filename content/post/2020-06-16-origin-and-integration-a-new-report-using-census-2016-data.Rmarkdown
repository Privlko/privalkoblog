We have a new report! 

We recently launched Origin and Integration, a piece of work that looks at migrant integration in Ireland. 
Here, we look at education, english language ability, unemployment and occupational attianment for migrants from over 100+ countries of birth.
It's a really exciting project, one that uses the entire migrant population in Ireland.
