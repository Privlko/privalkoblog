Hello, I am returning to the blog after a few months of absence. 
When I got back to it, I decided to update blogdown the R package that I use to combine writing and data analysis.
Safe to say this was a terrible idea, the fucntionality of the package has changed quite a bit since I started writing in 2017, and new posts were not appearing. 
After reading some of the suggestions around blogdown I basically tried to correct the issue myself, losing many of the previous posts from the last few years. 
I have saved these in a file, and will periodically try to load them back onto the blog.
