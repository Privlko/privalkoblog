<p>Hey there, I am going to try to update the blog in the coming weeks and redirect some of the content.
This post is more of a check to see what’s running and what needs updating.</p>
<p>As noted in my previous post, I have tried updating <code>blogdown</code>, losing quite a bit of content in the process.
Although there are other and newer packages written for blogging using R, I really don’t have the energy to go through the early stages of setting up these packages again.
For better or for worse, I am going to stick with <code>blogdown</code>.
If only because I still have a couple of posts that could be updated and rerun using the package (there might be data issues here so don’t quote me on this).</p>
<p>I have a number of posts in the works tied to RLMS’ income data, and how these differ from official statistics.
I also want to take a look at how official Irish stats can be graphed and better understood, including the Labour Force Survey which puts out quarterly reports, that will soon go monthly (I hear).</p>
<p>Beyond this, I hope to write some book reviews for the blog as well as updates on academic papers and other reviews that will come out in the coming weeks and months.</p>
