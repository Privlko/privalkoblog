Hello! 
Bertrand Ma√Ætre and I have a new article in The Economic and Social Review. 
We look at housing supplements (like HAP and RAS) and the social risk differences behind these payments. 
We also test whether housing supplements are associated with a fall in deprivation. 
Throughout the paper, we use three waves of data from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions. 

The work is useful to policy writers because it asks who receives housing supplements and further asks if these supplements are associated with better outcomes (an improved quality of life).
The work is useful to academics because it presents a different way of using cross sectional data to measure associations between transfers and outcomes, rather than comparing recipients to non-recipients (although we do this too, at times).
This approach still relies on equivalised household income, but it considers outcomes before and after such transfers.
The work is also useful to academics who write about housing in Ireland because we test levels of deprivation among people who receive housing supplements and compare these to people who are living in social housing.
We find that levels of deprivation among people receiving housing supplements are higher when compared to people who live in Local Authority housing, but that this difference is not statistically significant.
We guess that if levels of deprivation are relatively similar, this suggests that housing supplements are at a disadvantage because of their reliance on the private rental sector.
