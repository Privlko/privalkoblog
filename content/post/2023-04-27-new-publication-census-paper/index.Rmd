Dr. Fran McGinnity and I have a new paper out in the Journal of Immigrant and Refugee Studies. 
We use the full Irish Census to consider how migrants fare in the labour market. 
One important finding shows that people who come through the international protection system are penalized, even when they have comparable human capital.

This paper has been in the works for a long time, and stems from some of the reports we worked on using the full Irish Census.
As far as we know, this is the first time the full Irish census was used in such a way. 
[You can read the paper here, it's an open access publication.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15562948.2023.2196664)
