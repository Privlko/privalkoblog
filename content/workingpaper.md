This section contains some working papers. Typically these are not reviewed yet but they contain the main ideas or arguments.

* [Job Mobility and Earnings: Comparing Germany and the UK](/pdf/de-uk-workingpaper.pdf) In this paper I'm trying to compare the effects of quitting and the effects of moving due to a promotion in both countries. Germany typically has far less mobility than the UK, does this mean that the UK has more "life chances" than Germany? Or does it mean that the nature of mobility is different in both countries? I use eight years of panel data from both countries to explore the impact of both on monthly earnings.
