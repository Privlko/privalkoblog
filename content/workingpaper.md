This section contains some working papers. Typically these are not reviewed yet but they contain the main ideas or arguments.

* [Job Mobility and Earnings: Comparing Germany and the UK](/pdf/de-uk-workingpaper.pdf) In this paper I'm trying to compare the effects of quitting and the effects of moving due to a promotion in both countries. Germany typically has far less mobility than the UK, does this mean that the UK has more "life chances" than Germany? Or does it mean that the nature of mobility is different in both countries? I use eight years of panel data from both countries to explore the impact of both on monthly earnings.


* [Gender Differences in Russiaâ€™s Job Mobility and Its Rewards](/pdf/gender-paper.pdf) In this paper I try to compare men and women's chances of experiencing job mobility using cross sectional and longitudonal data. Gender differences in job mobility are minor, but the rewards tied to job mobility are far bigger, with young women benefitting most from job mobility, mainly promotions. I suggest that women's wages may be closer to the "floor", and that mobility in the early stages of their career is a crucial "life chance" that moves them out of the secondary labour market.
