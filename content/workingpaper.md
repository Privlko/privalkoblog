This section contains some working papers. Typically these are not reviewed yet but they contain the main ideas or arguments.

* [Migrant Labour and Integration in the Russian Federation](/pdf/migrants.pdf). In this paper I outline the main differences between migrant groups and non-migrant groups in terms of employment, official employment, and earnings. 
To date I have not found many articles  that compare integration outcomes for migrants using Russian data, and this paper would set researchers up well to consider the imapct of COVID-19 on migrant employment, and the participation of Ukrainians in Russia's labour market after the beginning the the Ukrainian-Russian war.

* [Job Mobility and Earnings: Comparing Germany and the UK](/pdf/de-uk-workingpaper.pdf) In this paper I'm trying to compare the effects of quitting and the effects of moving due to a promotion in both countries. Germany typically has far less mobility than the UK, does this mean that the UK has more "life chances" than Germany? Or does it mean that the nature of mobility is different in both countries? I use eight years of panel data from both countries to explore the impact of both on monthly earnings.
