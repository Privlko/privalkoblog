    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Thanks for visiting my blog. I’m looking forward to writing some posts about Russia, and learning some much needed R skills here. My rationale for starting, was to learn more about R and blogdown. Since you typically need data for both of those things, I decided to focus on something I’m interested in; Russian Society, labour markets, and sociology. If nothing else, this might be a good exercise for learning blocks of code.</p>
<p>This website was built with the most basic version of blogdown. I highly recommend the book by <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill</a> which talks you through the logic of the package. It’s also got some nice ideas on the importance of blogging and R (even when no one is listening). At this point, I should admit I struggled using the book alone (hence the fact that this blog is the most basic version of blogdown). I also relied heavily on notes from <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/">Alison Presmanes Hill</a>, and the instructional videos by both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edyzTo3DF4U">Alison</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjTLN-FXiFA&amp;t=3028s">Yihui</a>.</p>
<p>Two thoughts on starting the blog using the package. I may be the only one, but I felt that the importance of <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> was understated. I would have prefered a brief tutorial on using both R, github, and blogdown together. Luckily, the video by Alison discusses this briefly, and I was able to piece together what Github was from other sources. If you are a new R user and are thinking of starting blogdown, I highly suggest reading about GitHub first, this was my biggest obstacle to starting the blog. On a positive, since I picked up the basics I’m really enjoying the package. Previously, I was wiritng using WordPerfect and Stata. Writing code in one, then taking screenshots and slotting these into posts. This made the whole process time consuming and annoying. Writing the posts in blogdown has been great, and has taken far less time. Again, if you’re thinking of starting a data based blog, it may be a nicer alternative than wordpress.</p>
<p>Many thanks for getting this far.</p>
