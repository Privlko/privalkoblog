      <description>I started working on a new paper, one that looks at job mobility in the RLMS data-set.In general, I’m really interested in the effects of job changes on wages, but often reviewers ask about predicting mobility and the factors that correlate with mobility, so in this paper I’m trying to look at both of these things, which can get a bit convoluted.
Anyway, in this blog post I list a few visualisations from this paper which I’m including instead of tables.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to summarise a quick method for summarising random-effects output.
I’ve been working with multi-level models recently. During grad school I spent a lot of time using fixed-effects methods, which are less prone to bias but drop lots of information between cluster groups. Random effects models also have issues, but new methods have made it easier to overcome these.
There are tonnes of interesting courses and books on random effects modelling, which are worth reading.</description>
