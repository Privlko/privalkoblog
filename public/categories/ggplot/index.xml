      <description>I’ve heard a lot about the CSO’s r package used to pull data directly to R, but to date I haven’t tried it.I decided to take a look recently after having some trouble downloading the data and trying to move it from Excel into Stata or R, and then back into Word.It turns out the package is pretty easy to use and lets you simplify workflow quite a bit.</description>

      <description>In this post, I look at a small chart breaking down pay by gender and occupation. Russian wages are particularly flexible, employers have significant freedom in setting the earnings of “inefficient” workers. There’s also a lot of “hidden unemployment”, where workers see their hours deducted at times of low demand (or at the discretion of employers) and where unpaid leave is common. These reasons may contribute to Russia’s gender pay gap.</description>
