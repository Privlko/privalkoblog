      <description>This post explores job mobility data in the Russian labour market. Sociologists tend to see country differences in job mobility as stemming from country differences in institutions. I think these can be summarised into three cateogries.
First, there are differences in job protection and the freedom to fire or hire workers. Liberal countries, like the UK, have more mobility because hiring and firing workers is just easier. By the same token, coordinated economies like Germany, tend to have less mobility because firing workers, and the process of hiring, takes longer and contains more obstacles.</description>
