      <description>In this post I want to summarise a quick method for summarising random-effects output.
I’ve been working with multi-level models recently. During grad school I spent a lot of time using fixed-effects methods, which are less prone to bias but drop lots of information between cluster groups. Random effects models also have issues, but new methods have made it easier to overcome these.
There are tonnes of interesting courses and books on random effects modelling, which are worth reading.</description>

      <description>In this update, I want to update the blog with a practical post. I’ll try to group observations in the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey by individual. In a nutshell, every year, the survey asks people a series of questions, but some respondents are revisited and asked the same questions at another point in time. This is the basis for longitudinal data.
I should add a disclaimer, I have a limited knowledge of the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, and it’s possible that other, better methods exist.</description>
