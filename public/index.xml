      <title>Industry Differences in Pay</title>

      <description>In this post I outline industry differences in pay, with a special focus on gender. I already listed the occupational differences in a previous post. Here, I follow the same idea, but substitute industry for occupations.
As before, I use the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey for data on participants in 2015. I use a measure for gender, industry, the number of weekly hours worked, and gross wages.
I do not limit the industry codes, but focus on industry as it appears in the survey.</description>

      <title>Gender, occupations, and pay</title>

      <description>In this post, I look at a small chart breaking down pay by gender and occupation. Russian wages are particularly flexible, employers have significant freedom in setting the earnings of “inefficient” workers. There’s also a lot of “hidden unemployment”, where workers see their hours deducted at times of low demand (or at the discretion of employers) and where unpaid leave is common. These reasons may contribute to Russia’s gender pay gap.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a social researcher based in Dublin, Ireland. Here, I write about Russian inequality using cross sectional and longitudinal data. My main interests are the sociology of work, Russia&amp;rsquo;s place in comparative political economy, its wage inequality, and its social classes at work. I wrote my PhD on the consequences of job mobility in Germany and the UK; from time to time I&amp;rsquo;ll also blog about that.
Separately, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to learn about R Studio, data viz, and longitudinal or panel methods of analysis.</description>

      <description>Thanks for visiting my blog. I’m looking forward to writing some posts about Russia, and learning some much needed R skills here. My rationale for starting, was to learn more about R and blogdown. Since you typically need data for both of those things, I decided to focus on something I’m interested in; Russian Society, labour markets, and sociology. If nothing else, this might be a good exercise for learning blocks of code.</description>
