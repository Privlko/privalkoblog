      <description>I’ve heard a lot about the CSO’s r package used to pull data directly to R, but to date I haven’t tried it.I decided to take a look recently after having some trouble downloading the data and trying to move it from Excel into Stata or R, and then back into Word.It turns out the package is pretty easy to use and lets you simplify workflow quite a bit.</description>

      <description>Hello! I want to write a quick post about some recent reports and publications that have come out during this year and last year.
My paper on Russian job mobility was published in Economics of Transition and Institutional Change!The article looks at gender differences in mobility, before estimating what certain mobility types might mean for wages.I think there are some gaps in the article that could be addressed in a subsequent paper, like their strong marriage premiums that came up in the results and the strong effects of motherhood.</description>

      <title>Working with ESS data in R</title>

      <description>I came across a good step by step guide for using European Social Survey in R.I had some issues with the code, and in the end I found that tidyverse has some nice alternatives to the code preseneted, like the stuff on weighting, but in general this was a really interesting post.I want to walk through some of my workflow here.We can start by loading some of the ESS data for the Russian Federation.</description>

      <title>Industry Differences in Pay</title>
      <link>/2017/12/30/gender-parental/</link>

      <description>In this post I outline industry differences in pay, with a special focus on gender. I already listed the occupational differences in a previous post. Here, I follow the same idea, but substitute industry for occupations.
As before, I use the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey for data on participants in 2015. I use a measure for gender, industry, the number of weekly hours worked, and gross wages.
I do not limit the industry codes, but focus on industry as it appears in the survey.</description>

      <title>Gender, occupations, and pay</title>
      <link>/2017/12/20/gender-occupations-and-pay/</link>

      <description>In this post, I look at a small chart breaking down pay by gender and occupation. Russian wages are particularly flexible, employers have significant freedom in setting the earnings of “inefficient” workers. There’s also a lot of “hidden unemployment”, where workers see their hours deducted at times of low demand (or at the discretion of employers) and where unpaid leave is common. These reasons may contribute to Russia’s gender pay gap.</description>

      <description>Thanks for visiting my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to writing some posts about Russia, and learning some much needed R skills here. My rationale for starting, was to learn more about R and blogdown. Since you typically need data for both of those things, I decided to focus on something I&amp;rsquo;m interested in; Russian Society, labour markets, and sociology. If nothing else, this might be a good exercise for learning blocks of code.</description>
