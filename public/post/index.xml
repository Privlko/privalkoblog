      <title>Adding Observations in RLMS using R</title>

      <description>In this update, I want to update the blog with a practical post. I’ll try to group observations in the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey by individual. In a nutshell, every year, the survey asks people a series of questions, but some respondents are revisited and asked the same questions at another point in time. This is the basis for longitudinal data.
I should add a disclaimer, I have a limited knowledge of the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, and it’s possible that other, better methods exist.</description>

      <title>Vacancy and the CSO</title>

      <description>This post addresses the issue of housing vacancy. The views below are mine alone and represent my opinion and interpretation of the data; other interpretations exist.
tl;drI think housing vacancy is misunderstood, and often over-simplified. The current government is pursuing vacant homes in an effort to increase social housing supply. The strategy is unlikely to yield significant returns in Dublin, since the nature of Dublin’s vacancy may be misunderstood.</description>

      <title>Rising Income, Rising Price</title>

      <description>Rising Income, Rising PriceA recent report by myhome.ie (Q4 2017) listed several reasons for the sharp rise in house prices, especially in Dublin. The most noticeable was “rising incomes” and “strong job growth”. This may suggest the following; wages rose significantly in recent years, more disposable income meant more bidding between buyers which pushed the price of housing. I may be nitpicking; the report also lists other good reasons for the growth in price.</description>

      <title>Compensating Differentials and Premiums for &#34;Dangerous Work&#34;</title>

      <description>A key theory predicting differences in pay, and explaining pay inequality, lies in compensating differentials. This is the idea that pay premiums are attached to jobs that have unfavourable or dangerous working conditions. Thus, workers who are at risk earn more than equally skilled workers in safer jobs. The theory often gets cited by critics of the gender pay gap. Here, it is argued that women accept lower pay in trying to “buy” better working conditions (or simply more favourable conditions).</description>

      <title>Public Thoughts on Politics and Government</title>

      <description>The European Social Survey for 2016 lists variables on government and politics. These are worth exploring, especially with the rise of protests and public meetings against the Kremlin. Often, critics claim these are disingenuous movements, made to create media content in Europe and the States. Typically, they point to Putin’s high approval rating as a symbol that all is well, and the population holds pro-government views.
In this post I explore some specifics, how do Russians feel about government, their ability to impact policy, and their ability to influence political outcomes?</description>

      <title>Industry Differences in Pay</title>
      <link>/2017/12/30/gender-parental/</link>

      <description>In this post I outline industry differences in pay, with a special focus on gender. I already listed the occupational differences in a previous post. Here, I follow the same idea, but substitute industry for occupations.
As before, I use the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey for data on participants in 2015. I use a measure for gender, industry, the number of weekly hours worked, and gross wages.
I do not limit the industry codes, but focus on industry as it appears in the survey.</description>

      <title>Gender, occupations, and pay</title>
      <link>/2017/12/20/gender-occupations-and-pay/</link>

      <description>In this post, I look at a small chart breaking down pay by gender and occupation. Russian wages are particularly flexible, employers have significant freedom in setting the earnings of “inefficient” workers. There’s also a lot of “hidden unemployment”, where workers see their hours deducted at times of low demand (or at the discretion of employers) and where unpaid leave is common. These reasons may contribute to Russia’s gender pay gap.</description>

      <description>Thanks for visiting my blog. I’m looking forward to writing some posts about Russia, and learning some much needed R skills here. My rationale for starting, was to learn more about R and blogdown. Since you typically need data for both of those things, I decided to focus on something I’m interested in; Russian Society, labour markets, and sociology. If nothing else, this might be a good exercise for learning blocks of code.</description>
