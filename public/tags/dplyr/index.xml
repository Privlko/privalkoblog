      <description>I wanted to make a quick post about the dplyr:: function, case_when().More for my own sanity than for public outreach.In Stata, recoding variables is relatively straight forward, at least to me.However, I’ve recently tried to use recode() in dplyr:: and could not get my head around it.Someone on stackoverflow suggested using case_when() which is somewhat understandable.
Here’s an example.

      <title>Russian Opinion of Ukraine and Ukrainian Opinion of Russia</title>

      <description>Levada recently updated statistics on what Russian and Ukrainian citizens think of each other. I saw the update but forgot to dig into the numbers; yesterday’s events in Kerch reminded me to revisit these.
It seems like conflict between both countries is on the rise, but it’s worth looking back on how public opinion changed over the quieter months. In this post I merge the data gathered by Levada, and use some dplyr commands to simplify things, I then make a graph using ggplot.</description>
