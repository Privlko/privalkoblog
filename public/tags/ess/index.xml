      <description>I came across a good step by step guide for using European Social Survey in R.I had some issues with the code, and in the end I found that tidyverse has some nice alternatives to the code preseneted, like the stuff on weighting, but in general this was a really interesting post.I want to walk through some of my workflow here.We can start by loading some of the ESS data for the Russian Federation.</description>
