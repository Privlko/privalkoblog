      <description>I wanted to include a small update on two recent publications. I know the blog is a bit neglected this is because I’ve started a postdoc and my first few reports are coming out. The first is about unpaid work in Ireland and its gender differences. I just caught the tail end of the work as I started, but I’m glad I had an input. Generally we find high levels of unpaid work in Ireland when compared to other countries in Europe.</description>
