      <description>Levada recently updated statistics on what Russian and Ukrainian citizens think of each other. I saw the update but forgot to dig into the numbers; yesterday’s events in Kerch reminded me to revisit these.
It seems like conflict between both countries is on the rise, but it’s worth looking back on how public opinion changed over the quieter months. In this post I merge the data gathered by Levada, and use some dplyr commands to simplify things, I then make a graph using ggplot.</description>

      <title>Xenophobia towards migrants</title>

      <description>In this post I want to look at data on xenophobia and attitudes to migrants; collected by the Levada center. This dataset was recently updated and widely shared, there are some interesting trends in the graphs below, some of which tell conflicting stories about migrants and ethnicities. Mainly, the graphs show an increase in xenophobic attitudes, after a period of falling xenophobia. However, subtle signs of acceptance also emerge, which could indicate a willingness to live and work with migrants once Russians get to know such (hypothetical) people.</description>

      <title>Vacancy and the CSO</title>

      <description>This post addresses the issue of housing vacancy. The views below are mine alone and represent my opinion and interpretation of the data; other interpretations exist.
tl;drI think housing vacancy is misunderstood, and often over-simplified. The current government is pursuing vacant homes in an effort to increase social housing supply. The strategy is unlikely to yield significant returns in Dublin, since the nature of Dublin’s vacancy may be misunderstood.</description>
