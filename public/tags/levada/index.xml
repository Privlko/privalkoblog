      <description>A recent post from Russia’s Levada Centre caught my attention. On the topic of school and future careers, parents are asked what they would like their children to do, what professions they prefer them to choose.
Levada collected this data from 2004, so it’s possible to track parents’ expectations of their kids over time (somewhat).
The format is not ideal, occuaptions seem to be in broad categories, not all of which are related.</description>
