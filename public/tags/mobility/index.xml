      <description>Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about capturing internal and external mobility types in the RLMS. I previously wrote a small note on one measure in the RLMS. That particular post was kind of disappointing, the data suggested that mobility was extremely uncommon, and although Russia is a famously immobile labour market, where respondents stay in the same job even when employers decide to stop paying wages, it seems like this question may be skewed somehow.</description>
