      <description>Hello! I want to write a quick post about some recent reports and publications that have come out during this year and last year.
My paper on Russian job mobility was published in Economics of Transition and Institutional Change!The article looks at gender differences in mobility, before estimating what certain mobility types might mean for wages.I think there are some gaps in the article that could be addressed in a subsequent paper, like their strong marriage premiums that came up in the results and the strong effects of motherhood.</description>
