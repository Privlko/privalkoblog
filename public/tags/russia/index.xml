      <description>Levada recently updated statistics on what Russian and Ukrainian citizens think of each other. I saw the update but forgot to dig into the numbers; yesterday’s events in Kerch reminded me to revisit these.
It seems like conflict between both countries is on the rise, but it’s worth looking back on how public opinion changed over the quieter months. In this post I merge the data gathered by Levada, and use some dplyr commands to simplify things, I then make a graph using ggplot.</description>

      <description>A key theory predicting differences in pay, and explaining pay inequality, lies in compensating differentials. This is the idea that pay premiums are attached to jobs that have unfavourable or dangerous working conditions. Thus, workers who are at risk earn more than equally skilled workers in safer jobs. The theory often gets cited by critics of the gender pay gap. Here, it is argued that women accept lower pay in trying to “buy” better working conditions (or simply more favourable conditions).</description>
