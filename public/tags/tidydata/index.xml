      <description>In this post I want to look at data on xenophobia and attitudes to migrants; collected by the Levada center. This dataset was recently updated and widely shared, there are some interesting trends in the graphs below, some of which tell conflicting stories about migrants and ethnicities. Mainly, the graphs show an increase in xenophobic attitudes, after a period of falling xenophobia. However, subtle signs of acceptance also emerge, which could indicate a willingness to live and work with migrants once Russians get to know such (hypothetical) people.</description>

      <description>I started taking part in the #Tidytuesday challenge and have had a great time so far, working through the challenges and learning from others. I highly recommend getting involved, especially if you’re just starting out with ggplot and R studio.
This week the data came from a FiveThirtyEight article on alcohol consumption. The data looked like this.

      <title>Adding Observations in RLMS using R</title>

      <description>In this update, I want to update the blog with a practical post. I’ll try to group observations in the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey by individual. In a nutshell, every year, the survey asks people a series of questions, but some respondents are revisited and asked the same questions at another point in time. This is the basis for longitudinal data.
I should add a disclaimer, I have a limited knowledge of the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, and it’s possible that other, better methods exist.</description>
